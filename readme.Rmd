This repository houses code for the manuscript entitled "Coal's Toll: 22 years of Medicare deaths attributable to electricity generation". 

# Directories
- `code` This directory stores all code used as part of the project.
  - `00_organize_data.R` Code in this file reads in the outcome and exposure data into consistent formats. 
  - `01_coal_pm_mortality_models.R` Code in this file runs the stratefied poisson models.
  - `02_CI_bootstrap.R` Code in this file calculates the bootstrapped confidence intervals on the estimated hazard ratios 
  - `03_deaths_contributed.R` Code in this file combines coal power plant information with poisson model output to calculate deaths associated with each coal power plant's SO<sub>2<\sub> emissions.
  - `04_plots.R` Code in this file creates many of the charts in figures in the manuscript.
  - `05_compare_geos_chem.R`Code in this file compares the power plant deaths calculated in this study with comperable deaths calculated using GEOS-Chem adjoint sensitivities
- `data` Sensitive health data is not included in this repository, but all other datasets are saved here.
  - `cache_data` This subdirectory houses various ZIP code level data for input into the models. The sensitive data and large files have not been pushed to Github.
  - `adjoint_results`	This subdirectory houses deaths attributable to each coal unit from the GEOS-Chem adjoint sensitivities modeling
  - `denom_annual` This subdirectory houses annual denominator files for all Medicare beneficiaries
  - `coalpm25_to_obs_adjustment.csv` This file contains regional and year-specific adjustment factors for HyADS-derived coal PM<sub>2.5<\sub> to regional observed sulfate concentrations
- `figures` This directory contains figures from the manuscript
- `results` This directory contains two files
